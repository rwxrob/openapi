# ðŸŒ³ OpenAPITools from Go

This repo contains a Bonzai branch that lightly embeds and encapsulates
the `openapi-generator-cli` JAR from the [OpenAPITools project][]
allowing it to be used as high-level programmatic API from Go,
stand-alone `openapi` command, `openapi` subcommand within a Bonzai tree
monolith, or just to conveniently acquire and cache the current
`openapi-generator-cli` JAR file itself.
